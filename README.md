## Includes:

1. **Data Handling**

	* A DataHandler class that acts as a bridge between your data and a REST client making it easy to communicate with different APIs, retrieve data, and store it in csv format with a unified structure.
    * A datapipline module that can easily be adapted to fetch data of your favorite coin and time frame and store it into a csv file.
	* A collection of csv files with the data of your favorite coins to improve backtesting speed and enable coding work offline.

	</p>

    > The above flow chart shows the data flow from the exchange API through the datapipline into the database. From there we load the data to run backtests and produce detailed reports on all our trading strategies.

2. **Backtesting**

	* The Backtest class serves as a template for backtesting, making it easy to plug in your own strategies and see how they would have fared under different market conditions in the past.
	* Two ready-to-use examples for an example strategy and an example portfolio, making it easy to get started with backtesting your own strategies.
	* Backtest reports for the example strategy that provide a comprehensive overview of the strategy's performance, including plots of the equity curve and important performance metrics for different parameters.

	</p>

    > The backtest in the image above shows the returns that would have been achieved with the full portfolio of proprietary trading strategies starting 21st of February 2021.

3. **Live Trading**

	* A REST client to deal with Binance API, that you can easily adapt to work with your favorite exchange's API.
	* An abstract Strategy class that serves as a foundation for your strategies, providing a clear structure and a set of guidelines for implementation.
	* A a tried and tested trading strategy that serves as a blueprint for your own strategies or as a starting point to build upon.
	* A Portfolio class that makes combining your strategies into full cohesive, well-balanced portfolios as easy as one-two-three.

## Usage

### Live Trading

I personally run this code in the cloud and can help you get started.

If you are serious about setting up this framework on a cloud server, reach out to me.

### Writing a Strategy

Our example is a strategy that bets on the continuation of an ongoing trend. If the market is in an up-trend, and certain criteria are met, the strategy enters a long trade to profit from the continuation of the up-trend. In the same way, we enter a short trade if the market is in an ongoing down-trend.

Whilst the abstract strategy class is in the bot/src/ directory, the actual implementation of a particular strategy is in the bot/src/strategies directory. 

So, to implement our trend continuation strategy, we create a new file in the bot/src/strategies/ directory. In our case it is called ContinuationTrade.py. In this file we implement the trade logic in a class that inherits from Strategy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MarkusMusch/bot/blob/main/images/strategy_inheritance.png"
  width=50%>
</p>

The Strategy base class has a total of eight abstract methods that we have to implement in our child class.

The ```next_candle_init``` and ```next_candle_live``` methods give a public interface for our backtest and live trading modules to distinguish between initialization, backtesting, and live trading.

If we are initializing a strategy for live trading, we call the ```next_candle_init``` method. 


```Python
def  next_candle_init(self, row: pd.Series) -> None:
	"""Initializes the strategy by iterating through historical data
	without executing trades.

	Parameters
	----------
	row : pd.Series
	Row of historical data.
	"""

	self._setup_trade(row)
```


This method calls the ```setup_trade``` methods.

The ```setup_trade``` method checks if a trade set up has been triggered with the recent candle, and if yes, sets the trigger flag for a long or a short set up to ```True```.

If we are not trading live, we record the current equity in every step to evaluate the equity curve later on.

If we are trading live or running a backtest, we call the ```next_candle_live``` method.



```Python
def  next_candle_live(self, row: pd.Series) -> None:
"""Checks for valid trade set ups with new live data and execute live
trades.

Parameters
----------
row : pd.Series
Row of live data.
"""

self._execute_trade(row)
self._setup_trade(row)
```


This method calls both the ```execute_trade``` method to generate trading signals, and the ```setup_trade``` method to detect new set ups.

The ```execute_trade``` method checks if a new trigger has been set or if there is an existing position and calls the ```entry_long```, ```entry_short```, ```exit_long```, or ```exit_short``` method respectively.

If ```entry_long``` or ```entry_short``` is being called some more conditions such as a sufficient reward/risk ratio are being checked. If those conditions are satisfied a trade is being entered on exchange via our RESTClient object for live trading, or recorded without actual execution for backtesting.

If ```exit_long``` or ```exit_short``` is being called the current trade is being closed on exchange via our RESTClient object for live trading, or recorded without actual execution for backtesting.

### Assembling a Full Portfolio for Live Trading
To assemble your portfolio, define your tradable assets in Assets.py. Import them into the live.py module like this:

```Python
from  src.Assets  import  btc_cont_live, eth_cont_live, sol_cont_live, \
						  doge_cont_live
```

and define the markets you want to trade in the main function

```Python
if  __name__ == '__main__':

	markets = [btc_cont_live, eth_cont_live, sol_cont_live, doge_cont_live]

	portfolio = initialize_portfolio(markets, live=True)

	trade(portfolio)
```
As straight forward as can be.

### Writing Backtests: Single Strategies and Full Portfolios

#### Single Strategy Backtest
To set up a new backtest for an individual strategy, you will create a new .py file in the bot/back_tests/ directory with the name of your backtest.

You can copy paste the code from the exisiting backtest_continuation_trade.py module. In this module, we backtest the continuation trade strategy. For this we import the ContinuationTrade class like this:

```Python
from  src.strategies.ContinuationTrade  import  ContinuationTrade
```

You will replace this import line with the module and class of your own strategy. You can also change the preset list of markets and adjust the set of risk levels, leverage sizes, and reward/risk ratios if the predefined ones do not fit your particular use case.

```Python  
markets = [btc_cont, eth_cont, sol_cont, doge_cont]

risk_samples = [0.001, 0.005 , 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2]
leverage_samples = [1 , 3, 5, 10]
risk_reward = [2.0, 3.0]
```
If you want to trade markets that are not included in the current code, make sure to define them in the Assets.py module and import them.

The last step is to loop through all markets and run the backtests. Here you have to change the second argument "ContinuationTrade" to be *your* strategy.

```Python
for  market  in  markets:
	bt.run(ec, ContinuationTrade, market, risk_samples, leverage_samples,
		   risk_reward, Timeframes)
```
The Backtest object will also save a report of you backtest in the bot/back_tests/backtest_reports/ directory including equity curves and important performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and maximum draw down of your test run.

#### Full Portfolio Backtest

Setting up a full portfolio backtest works almost the same way as setting up a portfolio for live trading, which has been explained above.

To assemble your portfolio, define your tradable assets in Assets.py. Import them into the backtest_portfolio.py module like this:

```Python
from  src.Assets  import  btc_cont, eth_cont, sol_cont, doge_cont
```

and define the markets you want to trade in the main function

```Python
if  __name__ == '__main__':

markets = [btc_cont, eth_cont, sol_cont, doge_cont]

portfolio = initialize_portfolio(markets, live=False)
```
The only difference to setting up a live trading portfolio is that we set the live parameter to ```False``` when initializing the portfolio and not calling the trade function that initiates the scheduler for live trading.

</p>

### Getting Data

In Assets.py instantiate an object representing your asset. For a continuation trade on Bitcoin we do it like this:

```Python
btc_cont = Asset(ContinuationTrade, 'Continuation_Trade', 'BTCBUSD',
				 (58434.0, '2021-02-21 19:00:00+00:00'),
				 (57465.0, '2021-02-21 18:00:00+00:00'),
				 datetime(2021, 2, 21, 20, 0, 0, 0), 100,
				 Timeframes.ONE_HOUR.value, 0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 3)
```

In the datapipline.py module we define the tickers we are interested in.


```Python
busd_markets = ['BTCBUSD', 'ETHBUSD', 'SOLBUSD', 'DOGEBUSD']
```

In our case we are interested in the BUSD futures for $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and $DOGE. If you are interested in other coins you can find out their ticker on your exchange's website and replace them in the list above. Make sure to also adapt the classes in the RESTClient.py module if you are using another exchange.

Now we only need to run
```bash
Python3 datapipeline.py
```

in the terminal from the bot directory and it will load the requested data from the Binance futures API into csv files located in the bot/database/datasets directory.

By default, the time frames 1d, 1h, and 4h are implemented but if you are interested in other time frames you can easily extend the Enum

```Python
class  Timeframes(Enum):
	ONE_HOUR = '1h'
	FOUR_HOURS = '4h'
	ONE_DAY = '1d'
```

in Assets.py.

If, for example, you wanted to add the 5m time frame, you would simply add the line

```Python
FIVE_MINUTES = '5m'
```
in the Enum in Assets.py and the lines

```Python
download(market, Timeframes.FIVE_MINUTES.value, timedelta(minutes=4999))
print(Timeframes.FIVE_MINUTES.value + ' done! \n')
```
The ```timedelta``` this way since we can at most request 1000 data entries at a time from the Binance API. By default it is 500 data entries, but by explicitly requesting 1000 we can reduce the number of requests and therefore the time it takes to download our data.

### Unit Tests

To run the included unit tests execute

pytest -v -k "test_ms or test_data_fetch_current"

This does not all the included unit tests, but the remainder needs you to set up a Telegram bot. You will need to [set up a Telegram bot](https://sarafian.github.io/low-code/2020/03/24/create-private-telegram-chatbot.html) before you start trading live so the algorithm can send you messages to your phone upon entering and exiting trades.
