	</p>

    > The above flow chart shows the data flow from the exchange API through the datapipline into the database. From there we load the data to run backtests and produce detailed reports on all our teted strategies.

2. **Backtesting**

	* A Backtest class serving as a template for backtesting any strategy you will implement.
	* Two backtest modules for an example strategy and an example portfolio that you can copy paste and easily adapt to your use case.
	* Backtest reports for the example strategy including plots of the equity curve and important performance metrics for different parameters.

	</p>

    > The backtest in the image above shows the returns that would have been achieved with the full portfolio of proprietary trading strategies starting 21st of February 2021.

3. **Live Trading**

	* A REST client to deal with Binance API that you can easily adapt to work with your favorite exchanges' REST APIs.
	* An abstract Strategy class that serves as a template for implementing your own strategies.
	* An example strategy that serves as a blueprint for your own strategies or as a starting point to build upon.
	* A Portfolio class that makes combining your strategies into full portfolios straight forward.

## Usage

### Live Trading

I personally run this code in the cloud and can help you get started.

If you are serious about setting up this framework on a cloud server, reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-markus-musch-b504a21b7/).

### Writing a Strategy

Our example is a strategy that bets on the continuation of an ongoing trend. If the market is in an up-trend, and certain criteria are satisfied, the strategy enters a long trade to profit from the continuation of the up-trend. In the same way, we enter a short trade if the market is in an ongoing down-trend and certain criteria are satisfied.

Whilst the abstract strategy class is in the /bot/src/ directory, the actual implementation of a particular strategy is in the /bot/src/strategies directory. 

So, to implement our trend continuation strategy we create a new file in the /bot/src/strategies/ directory. In our case it is called ContinuationTrade.py. In this file we implement the trade logic in a class that inherits from Strategy.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/MarkusMusch/bot/blob/main/images/strategy_inheritance.png"
  width=50%>
</p>

The Strategy base class has a total of eight abstract methods that we have to implement in our child class.

The ```next_candle_init``` and ```next_candle_live``` methods give an interface for our backtest and live trading modules to distinguish between the two.

If we are initializing a strategy for live trading, we call the ```next_candle_init``` method. 


```Python
def  next_candle_init(self, row: pd.Series) -> None:
	"""Initializes the strategy by iterating through historical data
	without executing trades.

	Parameters
	----------
	row : pd.Series
	Row of historical data.
	"""

	self._setup_trade(row)
```


This method only calls the ```setup_trade``` methods.

The ```setup_trade``` method checks if a trade set up has been triggered with the recent candle, and if yes, sets the trigger flag for a long or a short set up to ```True```.

If we are not trading live, we record the current equity in every step to evaluate the equity curve later on. If we are trading live we skip this step.

If we are trading live, we call the ```next_candle_live``` method.



```Python
def  next_candle_live(self, row: pd.Series) -> None:
"""Checks for valid trade set ups with new live data and execute live
trades.

Parameters
----------
row : pd.Series
Row of live data.
"""

self._execute_trade(row)
self._setup_trade(row)
```


This method calls both the ```execute_trade``` method to generate live signals, and the ```setup_trade``` method to detect new set ups.

The ```execute_trade``` method checks if a new trigger has been set or if there is an existing position and calls the ```entry_long```, ```entry_short```, ```exit_long```, or ```exit_short``` method respectively.

If ```entry_long``` or ```entry_short``` is being called some more conditions such as a sufficient reward/risk ratio are being checked. If those conditions are satisfied a trade is being entered on exchange via our RESTClient object.

If ```exit_long``` or ```exit_short``` is being called the current trade is being closed on exchange via our RESTClient object.

### Assembling a Full Portfolio for Live Trading
To assemble your portfolio, define your tradable assets in Assets.py. Import them into the live.py module like this:

```Python
from  src.Assets  import  btc_cont_live, eth_cont_live, sol_cont_live, \
						  doge_cont_live
```

and define the markets you want to trade in the main function

```Python
if  __name__ == '__main__':

	markets = [btc_cont_live, eth_cont_live, sol_cont_live, doge_cont_live]

	portfolio = initialize_portfolio(markets, live=True)

	trade(portfolio)
```

### Writing Backtests: Single Strategies and Full Portfolios

#### Single Strategy Backtest
To set up a new backtest for an individual strategy, you will create a new .py file in the /bot/back_tests/ directory with the name of your backtest.

You can copy paste the code from the exisiting backtest_continuation_trade.py module. In this module, we backtest the continuation trade strategy. For this we import the ContinuationTrade class like this:

```Python
from  src.strategies.ContinuationTrade  import  ContinuationTrade
```

You will replace this import line with the module and class of your own strategy. You can also change the preset list of markets and adjust the set of risk levels, leverage sizes, and reward/risk ratios if the predefined ones do not fit your particular use case.

```Python  
markets = [btc_cont, eth_cont, sol_cont, doge_cont]

risk_samples = [0.001, 0.005 , 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2]
leverage_samples = [1 , 3, 5, 10]
risk_reward = [2.0, 3.0]
```
If you want to trade markets that are not included in the current code, make sure to define them in the Assets.py module and import them.

The last step is to loop through all markets and run the backtests. Here you have to change the second argument "ContinuationTrade" to be your strategy.

```Python
for  market  in  markets:
	bt.run(ec, ContinuationTrade, market, risk_samples, leverage_samples,
		   risk_reward, Timeframes)
```
The Backtest object will also save a report of you backtest in the /bot/back_tests/backtest_reports/ directory including equity curves and the most important performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and maximum draw down of your test run.

#### Full Portfolio Backtest

Setting up a full portfolio backtest works almost the same way as setting up a portfolio for live trading which has been explained above.

To assemble your portfolio, define your tradable assets in Assets.py. Import them into the backtest_portfolio.py module like this:

```Python
from  src.Assets  import  btc_cont, eth_cont, sol_cont, doge_cont
```

and define the markets you want to trade in the main function

```Python
if  __name__ == '__main__':

markets = [btc_cont, eth_cont, sol_cont, doge_cont]

portfolio = initialize_portfolio(markets, live=False)
```
The only difference to setting up a live trading portfolio is that we set the live parameter to ```False``` when initializing the portfolio and not calling the trade function that initiate the scheduler for live trading.

</p>

### Getting Data

In Assets.py instantiate an object representing your asset. For a continuation trade on Bitcoin we do it like this:

```Python
btc_cont = Asset(ContinuationTrade, 'Continuation_Trade', 'BTCBUSD',
				 (58434.0, '2021-02-21 19:00:00+00:00'),
				 (57465.0, '2021-02-21 18:00:00+00:00'),
				 datetime(2021, 2, 21, 20, 0, 0, 0), 100,
				 Timeframes.ONE_HOUR.value, 0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 3)
```

In the datapipline.py module we define the tickers we are interested in.


```Python
busd_markets = ['BTCBUSD', 'ETHBUSD', 'SOLBUSD', 'DOGEBUSD']
```

In our case we are interested in the BUSD futures for $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, and $DOGE. If you are interested in other coins you can find out their ticker on your exchanges' website and replace them in the list above. Make sure to also adapt the classes in the RESTClient.py module if you are using another exchange.

Now we only need to run
```bash
Python3 datapipeline.py
```

from the /bot directory and it will load the requested data from the Binance futures API into csv files located in the /bot/database/datasets directory.

By default, the time frames 1d, 1h, and 4h are implemented but if you are interested in other time frames you can easily extend the Enum

```Python
class  Timeframes(Enum):
	ONE_HOUR = '1h'
	FOUR_HOURS = '4h'
	ONE_DAY = '1d'
```

in Assets.py.

If, for example, you wanted to add the 5m time frame, you would simply add the line

```Python
FIVE_MINUTES = '5m'
```
in the Enum in Assets.py and the lines

```Python
download(market, Timeframes.FIVE_MINUTES.value, timedelta(minutes=4999))
print(Timeframes.FIVE_MINUTES.value + ' done! \n')
```
The ```timedelta``` this way since we can at most request 1000 data entries at a time from the Binance API. By default it is 500 data entries, but by explicitly requesting 1000 we can reduce the number of requests and therefore the time it takes to download our data.
